## Python Code Execution System

The system implements a robust execution environment for Python code directly within the application:

### Components

1. **Python Environment Management**:
   - Virtual environment in the SandBox directory
   - Basic dependencies installed (fastapi, uvicorn, psutil, etc.)
   - Support for additional package installation

2. **Execution Bridge**:
   - FastAPI backend server for Python execution
   - API endpoints for sync/async code submission
   - Secure execution sandbox with process isolation
   - Resource limits and execution timeouts
   - Error handling and execution status tracking

3. **UI Integration**:
   - PythonCodeNode component with editor and execution controls
   - React context for state management (PythonExecutionContext)
   - API client for communication (pythonBridge.ts)
   - Real-time execution status display
   - Results panel for viewing outputs

### Current Issues to Resolve

1. **Race Conditions in Status Updates**:
   - Problem: Multiple concurrent status updates can lead to inconsistent state
   - Progress: Started implementing useReducer for better state management
   - Next steps: Complete reducer implementation and test with concurrent operations

2. **Code Validation**:
   - Problem: Current validation is minimal and misses many potential errors
   - Progress: Added basic syntax checking
   - Next steps: Implement more comprehensive validation with clear error messages

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Problem: Inconsistent error handling across components
   - Progress: Started implementing error boundaries
   - Next steps: Complete error boundary implementation and standardize error handling

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Problem: Long-running or failed executions can cause memory leaks
   - Progress: Implemented background cleanup for completed executions
   - Next steps: Enhance cleanup process and add monitoring for resource usage

5. **Python Bridge Status**:
   - Problem: Users don't always know if the Python backend is available
   - Progress: Added status indicator and refresh button
   - Next steps: Implement automatic reconnection and better error reporting

## Technical Implementation Details

### MCP Node Implementation

- **Component Structure**
  - Node card with server type selector
  - Form fields for server configuration
  - Connection handles for Agent linkage
  - Resizable container with sci-fi theme styling

- **Server Types**
  - Git server (for repository analysis)
  - Filesystem server (for file access and manipulation)
  - Custom server (for other MCP-compatible tools)

- **Code Generation**
  - Import statements for MCP modules
  - Server initialization with proper parameters
  - Async connection handling

### Connection Points Enhancement

- Increased size (12px standard, 16px on hover)
- Color-coding by node type:
  - Agent: Cyan (#0cebeb)
  - Runner: Red (#F44336)
  - Tool: Orange (#FF9800)
  - Python Code: Green (#4CAF50)
  - MCP: Purple (#9C27B0)
- Improved visibility with stronger glow effects
- Added hover effects for better user feedback

### Python Execution Technical Details

- **Execution Process**:
  1. User writes Python code in the PythonCodeNode
  2. Code is sent to FastAPI backend via pythonBridge.ts
  3. Backend validates and sanitizes the code
  4. Code runs in isolated process with resource limits
  5. Results are returned to frontend
  6. UI updates with execution status and results

- **Security Measures**:
  - Process isolation with multiprocessing
  - Resource limits (CPU time, memory)
  - Execution timeouts
  - Blocked unsafe imports and operations
  - Input validation and sanitization

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Small code snippets run synchronously
  - Larger or async code runs asynchronously with status polling
  - Background cleanup for completed executions
  - Connection pooling for efficient API communication

## React Compatibility Issues

The project currently uses React 19.0.0, which is a future version not yet officially released. This causes several compatibility issues:

1. **Dependency Conflicts**:
   - Material-UI version 7.0.1 expects React 19 features
   - ReactFlow version 11.11.4 is designed for React 18
   - TypeScript types are inconsistent

2. **Import Errors**:
   - PythonCodeNode.tsx and PythonExecutionContext.tsx have import conflicts
   - Some React 19 specific hooks are not available in production builds

3. **Resolution Plan**:
   - Downgrade React to version 18.2.0
   - Update Material-UI to compatible version (5.x)
   - Fix import statements and type definitions
   - Update TypeScript configuration
