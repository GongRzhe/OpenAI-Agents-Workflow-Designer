## MCP Node Implementation Plan

The MCP Node system will enable connection to Model Context Protocol servers, extending agent capabilities by providing access to external tools such as Git repositories, filesystem access, and more.

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Component Structure**
   - Create basic MCPNode.tsx component
   - Define data structure and props
   - Implement NodeDataContext integration

2. **Phase 2: UI Development**
   - Design sci-fi themed MCP node card
   - Create server type selection dropdown
   - Implement server configuration fields
   - Add connection handles

3. **Phase 3: Code Generation**
   - Update codeGenerator.ts to support MCP nodes
   - Generate proper imports and server initialization
   - Handle connection to Agent nodes
   - Support different server types

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Documentation**
   - Test with Git MCP server
   - Test with Filesystem MCP server
   - Create examples and documentation
   - Update README.md with MCP features

### Features

1. **Server Type Selection**
   - Git - For repository analysis
   - Filesystem - For file access and manipulation
   - Custom - For other MCP-compatible servers
   - Stdio - For command-line tool integration
   - SSE - For event stream communication

2. **Configuration Options**
   - Command and arguments
   - Working directory
   - Environment variables
   - Server name
   - Tool caching toggle

3. **Connection System**
   - Connection to Agents to provide tools
   - Visual indicator for MCP-Agent connections
   - Proper handle styling and positioning

4. **Generated Code**
   - Server initialization and connection
   - Error handling and cleanup
   - Tool registration with agents
   - Async/await pattern for MCP operations

### Technical Considerations

1. **MCP Server Requirements**
   - Ensure required packages are installed
   - Add documentation for server prerequisites
   - Handle connection errors gracefully

2. **State Management**
   - Store MCP node configuration in NodeDataContext
   - Allow updating server parameters
   - Persist settings in project files

3. **Code Generation**
   - Generate imports for MCP modules
   - Create server initialization code
   - Connect servers to appropriate agents
   - Include error handling and cleanup

4. **UI Elements**
   - Server type selector
   - Command and arguments fields
   - Environment variable editor
   - Tool caching toggle
   - Connection handles
   - Visual feedback for connection status

## Python Code Execution System

The system implements a robust execution environment for Python code directly within the application:

### Components

1. **Python Environment Management**:
   - Virtual environment in the SandBox directory
   - Basic dependencies installed (fastapi, uvicorn, psutil, etc.)
   - Support for additional package installation

2. **Execution Bridge**:
   - FastAPI backend server for Python execution
   - API endpoints for sync/async code submission
   - Secure execution sandbox with process isolation
   - Resource limits and execution timeouts
   - Error handling and execution status tracking

3. **UI Integration**:
   - PythonCodeNode component with editor and execution controls
   - React context for state management (PythonExecutionContext)
   - API client for communication (pythonBridge.ts)
   - Real-time execution status display
   - Results panel for viewing outputs

### Current Issues to Resolve

1. **Race Conditions in Status Updates**:
   - Problem: Multiple concurrent status updates can lead to inconsistent state
   - Solution: Implement more robust state management with useReducer and careful async handling

2. **Code Validation**:
   - Problem: Current validation is minimal and misses many potential errors
   - Solution: Implement more comprehensive validation with clear error messages

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Problem: Inconsistent error handling across components
   - Solution: Standardize error handling and implement error boundaries

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Problem: Long-running or failed executions can cause memory leaks
   - Solution: Implement proper cleanup for completed executions and error cases

5. **Python Bridge Status**:
   - Problem: Users don't always know if the Python backend is available
   - Solution: Implement clear status indicators with automatic reconnection

  - Agent: Cyan (#0cebeb)
  - Runner: Red (#F44336)
  - Tool: Orange (#FF9800)
  - Python Code: Green (#4CAF50)
  - MCP: Purple (#9C27B0)
- Improved visibility with stronger glow effects
- Added hover effects for better user feedback

### Python Execution Technical Details

- **Execution Process**:
  1. User writes Python code in the PythonCodeNode
  2. Code is sent to FastAPI backend via pythonBridge.ts
  3. Backend validates and sanitizes the code
  4. Code runs in isolated process with resource limits
  5. Results are returned to frontend
  6. UI updates with execution status and results

- **Security Measures**:
  - Process isolation with multiprocessing
  - Resource limits (CPU time, memory)
  - Execution timeouts
  - Blocked unsafe imports and operations
  - Input validation and sanitization

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Small code snippets run synchronously
  - Larger or async code runs asynchronously with status polling
  - Background cleanup for completed executions
  - Connection pooling for efficient API communication
