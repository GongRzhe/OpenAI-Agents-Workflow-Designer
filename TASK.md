  - Lazy loading for node properties
  - Optimized code generation for large workflows
  - Memory usage improvements

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor duplicate code across node components
  - Extract common node functionality to shared components
  - Create consistent styling system
  - Standardize node configuration interfaces

- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
  - Unit tests for node components
  - Integration tests for workflow operations
  - API tests for Python execution
  - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

- [ ] Update browser compatibility checks
  - Verify functionality across major browsers
  - Add fallbacks for unsupported features
  - Improve mobile/tablet support

## Bug Fixes Needed

- [ ] Fix race conditions in PythonCodeNode.tsx
  - Issue: Multiple status updates can cause state inconsistencies
  - Solution: Implement proper state management with useReducer (started)

- [ ] Fix Python code validation
  - Issue: Current validation is minimal and misses potential errors
  - Solution: Implement more robust validation with clear error messages

- [ ] Resolve React version compatibility issues
  - Issue: Project uses React 19 (not yet released) with incompatible deps
  - Solution: Downgrade to React 18.2.0 and update dependencies

- [ ] Fix memory leaks in Python execution
  - Issue: Long-running executions can cause memory build-up
  - Solution: Implement proper cleanup for completed executions
